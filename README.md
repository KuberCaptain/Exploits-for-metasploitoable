# VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Exploit

This project demonstrates an exploit for the VSFTPD v2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability. The exploit is implemented in C# and allows an attacker to gain access to a vulnerable server by exploiting a malicious backdoor that was present in VSFTPD version 2.3.4.

## Description

VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Daemon) version 2.3.4 was found to contain a backdoor in the downloadable archive. This backdoor allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This exploit takes advantage of this backdoor by sending specific commands to the FTP server, which triggers the backdoor and provides shell access.

## Features

- Connects to the target FTP server and retrieves the banner.
- Sends a specially crafted `USER` command to trigger the backdoor.
- Attempts to connect to the backdoor on port 6200.
- If successful, sends a payload to gain shell access.
- Provides an interactive shell to execute commands on the remote server.
